            <p>How do you make sure that every participant in a process, regardless of the distance between them, has the same information and ensure that they recieved it in a secure way? This is a very old and interesting problem.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Byzantine Generals Problem describes the difficulty decentralized systems have in agreeing on a single truth.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    The Byzantine Generals Problem plagued money for millennia, until the invention of Bitcoin.

                <li>
                    Bitcoinâ€™s ruleset is objective, so there is no disagreement about which blocks or transactions are valid, allowing all members to agree on a single truth.

            <p>An interesting way bitcoin can be used to solve the traditional example of the byzantine generals problem could be creating several sets of tactical plans in advance and only executing the plan that corresponds to a transaction to a specific address. In effect, all parties have a 'shared secret' that is used to establish a uniform understanding and because of that, there is greatly reduced risk of the mission being compromised due to the use of faulty or infiltrated digital and/or analog communications. To the adversary, this 'signal' transaction simply appears as anonymous network transaction data, revealing no sensitive information during the process of signaling itself. Because the transaction of history on the bitcoin network is immutable, the 'signal' transaction can be trusted, else it would reveal the point of compromise to be at the source of the decision making faculty that is executing the signal transactions.</p>
